## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Project Foundation
- ✅ Clean Architecture implementation
- ✅ Dual Flutter app structure (Citizen + Authority)
- ✅ Firebase services integration
- ✅ Core domain entities (User, Issue, Alert, GeoLocation)
- ✅ Error handling framework
- ✅ Type definitions and utilities

### 2. Firebase Configuration
- ✅ Firestore security rules
- ✅ Storage security rules
- ✅ Database indexes for performance
- ✅ Emulator configuration for local development

### 3. Dependencies Setup
- ✅ State management (flutter_bloc)
- ✅ Firebase services (auth, firestore, storage, messaging)
- ✅ Maps integration (google_maps_flutter)
- ✅ Image handling (image_picker, cached_network_image)
- ✅ Localization support (flutter_localizations)
- ✅ UI components (flutter_svg, lottie)

## 🚀 Next Steps

The foundation is ready! You can now proceed with implementing the core features:

### Immediate Next Tasks:
1. **Authentication System** (Task 3) - Firebase Auth with role-based access
2. **User Registration** (Task 4) - Profile management with city selection
3. **Issue Reporting** (Task 5) - Core reporting functionality with maps
4. **Real-time Tracking** (Task 6) - Live status updates and notifications

### Development Workflow:
1. Open `.kiro/specs/pulsea-civic-app/tasks.md`
2. Click "Start task" next to the task you want to implement
3. Follow the detailed task descriptions and requirements
4. Test each feature incrementally

## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Citizen App
```bash
cd local_pulse_citizen
flutter run                    # Run the app
flutter test                   # Run tests
flutter build apk             # Build Android APK
flutter build ios             # Build iOS app
```

### Authority App
```bash
cd local_pulse_authority
flutter run                    # Run the app
flutter test                   # Run tests
flutter build apk             # Build Android APK
flutter build ios             # Build iOS app
```

### Firebase Emulators (Optional for local testing)
```bash
firebase emulators:start       # Start all emulators
firebase emulators:ui          # Open emulator UI (localhost:4000)
```

## 🎯 Key Architecture Decisions

### Clean Architecture Benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test business logic independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features and modify existing ones

### Firebase Integration:
- **Real-time Updates**: Firestore listeners for live data synchronization
- **Offline Support**: Built-in offline capabilities with automatic sync
- **Security**: Comprehensive security rules for data protection
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling with serverless architecture

### Dual App Strategy:
- **Citizen App**: Optimized for reporting and tracking issues
- **Authority App**: Specialized for management and analytics
- **Shared Core**: Common entities and utilities for consistency

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

### Firebase Setup Required:
1. Create Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Enable Authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Cloud Messaging
3. Download configuration files:
   - `google-services.json` for Android
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS
4. Place files in respective platform directories

### Google Maps Setup Required:
1. Get API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Enable Maps SDK for Android/iOS and Geocoding API
3. Add API key to platform configuration files

## 📱 Current App Status

Both apps are currently showing a development splash screen and basic home screen. The foundation is solid and ready for feature implementation.

### Citizen App Features:
- Green civic-themed UI
- Splash screen with Local Pulse branding
- Dark/light theme support
- Development placeholder screen

### Authority App Features:
- Blue authority-themed UI
- Admin-focused branding
- Dashboard placeholder
- Analytics chart library (fl_chart) included

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Schemes:
- **Citizen App**: Green theme (#2E7D32) - representing growth and community
- **Authority App**: Blue theme (#1565C0) - representing trust and authority

### Typography & Accessibility:
- Material 3 design system
- Accessibility-compliant contrast ratios
- Support for multiple screen sizes
- Age-friendly UI considerations
