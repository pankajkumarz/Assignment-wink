# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a post-submission feedback system that prompts users to provide feedback and ratings after successfully submitting an issue report. This will help improve the reporting experience and gather valuable user insights about the submission process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a citizen who has just submitted an issue report, I want to be prompted to provide feedback about my submission experience, so that I can help improve the system and feel heard by the local authorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the feedback dialog appears THEN the system SHALL provide options to rate the submission experience from 1 to 5 stars
3. WHEN the feedback dialog appears THEN the system SHALL provide a text field for optional written feedback
4. WHEN the user interacts with the feedback dialog THEN the system SHALL allow them to skip providing feedback
5. WHEN the user provides feedback THEN the system SHALL save the feedback data locally
6. WHEN the user completes or skips feedback THEN the system SHALL navigate them back to the home screen or my issues page

### Requirement 2

6. WHEN the feedback is being processed THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to collect and store user feedback data, so that I can analyze user satisfaction and identify areas for improvement in the issue reporting process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the rating (1-5 stars) with timestamp
2. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the optional text feedback with timestamp
3. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL associate the feedback with the submitted issue ID
4. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the user ID (if available) for analytics
5. WHEN feedback data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure data persistence across app sessions
6. IF feedback submission fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without blocking user navigation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a citizen, I want the feedback process to be optional and non-intrusive, so that I can choose whether to provide feedback without feeling forced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the feedback dialog appears THEN the system SHALL make it clear that feedback is optional
2. WHEN the user chooses to skip feedback THEN the system SHALL not show the dialog again for that specific submission
3. WHEN the user dismisses the dialog THEN the system SHALL treat it as skipping feedback
4. WHEN the user has previously provided feedback THEN the system SHALL not prompt again for the same submission
5. WHEN the feedback dialog is shown THEN the system SHALL auto-dismiss after a reasonable timeout if no interaction occurs
