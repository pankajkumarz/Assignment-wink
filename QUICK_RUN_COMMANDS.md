# ðŸš€ Quick Commands to Run Local Pulse on Your Phone

I've fixed the compilation errors. Here are the exact commands:

## ðŸ“± Run on Your Samsung Phone:

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd Assignment-wink/local_pulse_citizen

# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run on your phone
flutter run -d RZCW114RM4D
```

## ðŸ”§ Alternative Commands:

### If the device ID doesn't work:
```bash
flutter run
# Then select your Samsung phone from the list
```

### For faster performance (release mode):
```bash
flutter run --release -d RZCW114RM4D
```

### To check connected devices:
```bash
flutter devices
```

## âœ… What's Fixed:
- âœ… API keys configuration
- âœ… Missing type definitions

## ðŸ“± Expected Result:
Your Local Pulse civic app will:
